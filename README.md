# CA-Suite
A unified engineering portfolio integrating CAD, code, animations, and rendering.
# CA Suite Journey

Welcome to my Computational Assembly (CA) Suite project! This repo tracks my progress from zero to a full GitHub portfolio, CAD library, Manim channel, Blender showreel, code templates, and capstone projects. Built for mechanical engineering workflows—think parametric CAD, animations, and automation.

## Project Structure
- `/code`: Python/C++/Java templates for automation and analysis.
- `/cad`: Fusion 360 parametric models (using Git LFS for large files).
- `/manim`: Manim Community Edition scenes and rendered videos.
- `/blender`: Blender mechanical animations and showreels.
- `/capstones`: Integrated projects combining 3+ tools.

## Roadmap
Follow the 8-stage plan to hit all deliverables. Current stage: Stage 1 complete—moving to Git workflow.

## Tools Used
- CAD: Fusion 360
- Animation: Manim, Blender
- Code: Python, C++, Java
- Version Control: Git + GitHub + LFS

### Quick Start
1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/kingselem/CA-Suite.git`
2. Install dependencies (see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for details).
3. Branch off for work: `git checkout -b cad` (for CAD tasks).

Star/fork if this inspires your own CA Suite! 🚀
